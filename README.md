# Project Title
2D Game Development in Java

## Project Description
A 2D game development project using Java, focusing on creating a fully functional game with player interaction, tile management, and a game panel.

## Project Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Java libraries for graphics and game development (e.g., JavaFX, libGDX)

## Implementations
### Game Class
The Game class serves as the main entry point for the game, handling game logic, updates, and rendering.

### Player Sprite
The Player sprite represents the player character in the game, with properties such as position, velocity, and animation.

### Key Input Handler
The Key input handler manages user input, translating keyboard and mouse events into game actions.

### Game Tiles
Game tiles are the building blocks of the game world, comprising terrain, obstacles, and interactive elements.

### Tile Manager
The Tile manager oversees the creation, placement, and updating of game tiles, ensuring efficient rendering and collision detection.

### Game Panel
The Game panel is the graphical user interface for the game, displaying the game world, player information, and other relevant data.
